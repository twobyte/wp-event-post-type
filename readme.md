## Description

This plugin registers a custom post type for events.  It also registers separate taxonomies for tags and categories.  If featured images are selected, they will be displayed in the column view.  

It doesn't change how event items are displayed in your theme however.  You'll need to add templates for archive-event.php and single-event.php if you want to customise the display of event items.

## Installation ==

Just install in the plugins folder and activate.
